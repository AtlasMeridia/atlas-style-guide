# Aesthetic Direction

This directory contains subjective, impressionistic notes on visual direction for ATLAS Meridia. Unlike the structured design tokens in `/data/tokens.json`, these are mood-based guidelines that inform creative decisions.

## Structure

- `print/` - Aesthetic direction for print materials
  - `stationery.md` - Letterhead, envelopes, note cards

## Reference Images

Curated reference images live in `/public/aesthetic/` and are viewable via the app.

## TODO

Find a dedicated platform for mood boards and visual direction. This documentation is an interim solution—consider migrating to:
- Are.na
- Figma mood boards
- A dedicated visual reference system

For now, these markdown notes serve as a searchable reference for AI agents and quick human lookup.
